            <h3>🚨 Not a Substitute for Professional Treatment</h3>
            <p><strong>BeepBoop+ Recovery is NOT a replacement for professional medical treatment, therapy, counseling, or addiction treatment programs.</strong></p>
            <p>This app is a supportive tool designed to complement—not replace—professional care. Addiction recovery often requires medical supervision, especially for substances that can cause dangerous withdrawal symptoms.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>🏥 Seek Professional Help</h2>
        <p>You should consult with qualified healthcare professionals, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Addiction medicine specialists</li>
            <li>Licensed therapists or counselors</li>
            <li>Psychiatrists or psychologists</li>
            <li>Your primary care physician</li>
            <li>Certified addiction counselors</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="important-box">
            <h3>⚠️ Dangerous Withdrawal Warning</h3>
            <p>Withdrawal from certain substances can be <strong>life-threatening</strong> and requires medical supervision. These include but are not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Alcohol</strong> - Can cause seizures, delirium tremens (DTs), and death</li>
                <li><strong>Benzodiazepines</strong> - Can cause seizures and life-threatening complications</li>
                <li><strong>Opioids</strong> - While rarely fatal, can be extremely dangerous without medical support</li>
                <li><strong>Barbiturates</strong> - Can cause fatal seizures</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>NEVER attempt to detox from these substances without medical supervision.</strong></p>
        </div>
